## Introduction

AI Image Generator is a full-stack web application that uses OpenAI's DALL-E model API to generate images from textual prompts. The app provides users with the ability to generate an image from their own description or use the "surprise me" button to generate a random image. Users can also search for images generated by other users and share their own images with the community.

## Technology Used

AI Image Generator was built using the following technologies:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- React
- Node.js and Express
- MongoDB
- Tailwind CSS

The images generated by the app are stored in Cloudinary and rendered using a serverless infrastructure.

## Features

- Dynamic hover effect that displays the prompt used to generate the image, the user's name, and a download button.
